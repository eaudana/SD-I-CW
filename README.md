# SD-I-CW

The University requires a program to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic
year. You should write this program in Python using the data shown in Table 1.

Part 1 - Main Version
A. Outcomes (28 marks)
• The program should allow students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each
academic year. The program should prompt for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail
and then display the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student (i.e.,
progress, trailing, module retriever or exclude).
B. Validation (12 marks)
• The program should display ‘Integer required’ if a credit input is the wrong data type.
• The program should display ‘Out of range’ if credits entered are not in the range 0, 20, 40,
60, 80, 100 and 120.
• The program should display ‘Total incorrect’ if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is
not 120.
• A few marks will be allocated for the efficient use of conditional statements. For example,
the program does not need 28 conditional statements for 28 outcomes.
• An example of the program running with user input (shown in bold):
Please enter your credits at pass: p
Integer required
Please enter your credits at pass: 140
Out of range.
Please enter your credits at pass: 100
Please enter your credit at defer: 40
Please enter your credit at fail: 20
Total incorrect.
Please enter your credits at pass: 100
Please enter your credit at defer: 20
Please enter your credit at fail: 0
Progress (module trailer)
C. Multiple Outcomes (12 marks)
• The program loops to allow a staff member to predict progression outcomes for multiple
students.
• The program should prompt for credits at pass, defer and fail and display the appropriate
progression for each individual student until the staff member enters ‘q’ to quit. Optionally
you can use an input of ‘y’ to continue.
• See example of program run combined with Histogram below.
D. Histogram (8 marks)
• When ‘q’ is entered, the program should produce a ‘histogram’ where each star represents a
student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module
retriever and exclude. The histogram should relate to the data input entered during the
program run and work for any number of outcomes.
• Display the number of students for each progression category and the total number of
students.
• Example of a program run and input (in bold). Note: program should exit on ‘q’ to quit. ‘y’ to
continue shown in the example is optional and depends on your program structure.

• Submit the completed part 1 test plan provided with your final part 1 solution.

Part 2 – List (extension) (6 marks)
For Part 1, most of the solutions would use variables to store the input data. For Part 2, extend your
solution so that the program saves the input progression data to a list or nested list. Then access the
stored data from the list and print the data in the following format below. Test plan not required.
Example Output: The following should display after the histogram

Part 2:
Principles I
4COSC001W: Coursework Specification Page | 5
Progress - 120, 0, 0
Progress (module trailer) - 100, 0, 20
Module retriever - 80, 20, 20
Module retriever - 60, 0, 60
Exclude – 40, 0, 80
Part 3 - Text File (extension) (6 marks)
For this part you could create an additional Part 3 program or extending your original version. Use
python to save any inputted progression data to a text file. Later in the program, access the stored
data and print out as shown below. Test plan not required. Example output (with data from text file):

Part 3:
Progress - 120, 0, 0
Progress (module trailer) - 100, 0, 20
Module retriever - 80, 20, 20
Module retriever - 60, 0, 60
Exclude – 40, 0, 80
Part 4 – Dictionary (separate program) (6 marks)
For Part 4, create a program that saves the input progression data to a dictionary or nested dictionary.
Then access the data stored in the dictionary and print to the screen. The solution should collect the
unique student ids as part of the input and display with the outcomes. Example output is shown
below. Test plan not required.

Part 4:
w1234567 : Progress - 120, 0, 0 w1234566 :
Progress (module trailer) - 100, 0, 20 w1234565
: Module retriever - 80, 20, 20 w1234564 :
Module retriever - 60, 0, 60 w1234563 : Exclude
– 40, 0, 80
Note: The solution should work with the data input entered during the program run and work for
any number of outcomes.
